    If this option is unchecked, then the plugin analyzes the code changes between the current build and
    the reference build. Currently, this feature is only available for Git and requires the
    <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-forensics">git-forensics plugin</a>
    to be installed. Based on this delta report, issues are then classified
    as new or outstanding. Only issues that are part of the obtained diff will be marked as new.
    If this operation slows down your build, you can use this option to deactivate this feature.
